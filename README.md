# UFO Sightings Website
## Overview
This project seeks to take a Kaggle dataset of primarily US-based UFO sightings and build an interactive HTML website to pull from and report the dataset. 

## Results 
This webpage will be used to ensure this valuable data is open and accessible to those who don't have the time or skills to pull and analyze JSON data files. In this screenshot, you can see that the data as presented in its native file is pretty easy to read, but to scroll through and do any kind of analysis would not be feasible.

However, because we have utilized JavaScript and Bootstrap, this data is now presented in an aesthetically pleasing, filterable webpage, which allows people with all levels of data analysis skill to dig into and understand the data. For instance, with this dataset I was able to check if there had been a UFO sighting on my birthday in 2010 (no luck), if there had been any UFO sightings in my hometown (no dice, again), but taking one step out I was able to see all the UFO sightings in the state in which I now live:

Further, this reveals a new level of utility, as without the state-level filter, I would not have known there was a UFO sighting as close as Round Rock, TX, as searches for Austin, TX did not pull any results.     
    
## Summary
In summary, this webpage introduces a new level of accessibility and utility to this dataset. However, one draw-back is some summary or context of the dataset. For instance, it was only through my knowledge of the dataset that I understood these were only UFO sightings from 2010, and that the country code is relatively less useful as only a handful of Canadian sightings are present in the data. 
    
One recommendation to continue development would be to provide a map of sightings, so that even if there are no results for someone's specific city, they can see the nearest or nearby sightings. A second recommendation is to perform summary statistical analysis to examine any patterns in when UFOs appear throughout the year, possibly building out to additional pages within the website.
